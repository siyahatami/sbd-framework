## SbD Review Checklist

The Secure-by-Design checklist set is a practical tool for embedding security requirements into the design phase of the software development lifecycle and for ensuring those requirements are verified before implementation. It serves as a clear, concise mechanism for product teams to self‑assess their designs, capture evidence, and internally document their security posture—without introducing unnecessary delays. These checklists are intended primarily for internal team self‑review and as a shared communication tool with the AppSec team in high‑risk projects.

Checklists translate the framework’s principles and recommendations (tab Principals) into actionable, reviewable controls. They ensure that security‑critical aspects are consistently considered, documented, and validated across all projects, regardless of the team’s size, experience, or technology stack. When used systematically, they reduce rework, strengthen the security posture, and enable efficient, scalable collaboration within the team and, where appropriate, with AppSec.

SbD Review Checklist defines the structure, intended usage, and governance of Secure‑by‑Design checklists, clarifying how they fit into the design process and how they can be maintained alongside other project artefacts.

### ◽ Intended Use and Timing

The SbD review checklist is completed by the product team during the design phase—ideally before high-level design sign-off or epic kickoff—and is refreshed whenever the design changes in a way that could alter the system’s security characteristics. Typical triggers include new integrations, exposure to untrusted networks, handling of sensitive data, adoption of new technologies, or changes to core workflows.

Begin with the full checklist during detailed design sessions—either from the outset of design work or as a dedicated security refinement step—to systematically think through applicable recommendations listed in tab Principal and update the design accordingly. Capture your considerations and decisions either directly within the design artefacts or in a separate security notes document; for internal peer review, assurance, and historical record.

Once these detailed considerations have been addressed, complete the SbD review checklist to summarize them into a clear, high-level mapping against the security requirements identified earlier. This becomes the main descriptive summary of applied considerations, along with any gaps to address later, and is stored with the project’s artefacts for ongoing reference. Where the project is high‑risk, this document can also support discussions with the AppSec to request guidance or additional assurance. See Escalation and risk thresholds.

### ◽ Checklist Structure

Each checklist entry contains:

- **ID** – Unique identifier for traceability.
- **Control Statement** – The security control or question to be addressed.
- **Status** – _Yes / No / N-A_.
- **Justification** – Stable links to ADRs, diagrams, configurations, relevant policy references, or including brief explanations or justifications where relevant.
- **Severity** – High, Medium, or Low if the control is not implemented.
- **Comment** – Supplementary notes for any status value, including clarification, additional context, or rationale for “N-A” and “No”.

### ◽ SbD Review Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum set of controls that every design is expected to address. A Xlsx version is available [here](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-secure-by-design-framework/blob/main/resources/artifacts/OWASP-SbD-Review-Checklist.xlsx?raw=true). Each item abstracts key recommendations from tab Principal, streamlined to support a Yes/No/N-A decision backed by evidence. For each control, teams record _Status_, _Justification_, _Severity_, and _Comments_. Items marked (Critical) are generally required to be Yes at design sign-off, or to have an approved, time-bound mitigation plan in place.

#### A. Architecture & Service Design

| ID    | Control Statement                                                                                                                 | Critical |

### ◽ Escalation & Risk Thresholds

If any critical control is No, or the overall risk score exceeds your team’s threshold, engage AppSec before development proceeds. Critical controls typically include those related to trust boundaries, encryption in transit/at rest, authentication and authorization, and incident readiness.

**Suggested scoring:** Yes \= 0, N-A \= 0 (with justification), No (Low) \= 1, No (Med) \= 2, No (High) \= 4\.  
**Escalate when:** any critical \= No, or total score ≥ 6, or any trigger from §2.4 applies (new external exposure, sensitive data, novel tech, Tier‑1 impact).  
**Review scope:** AppSec team reviews the checklist and linked evidence, advises on mitigations, and may request deeper verification or threat modeling.

### ◽ Governance and Maintenance

Checklists are version-controlled alongside design documentation in the project repository and remain internal to the team unless explicitly shared for external review.  
 Changes to checklist scope or content follow a documented change-control process, with major changes triggering a version increment and minor editorial changes noted in a changelog.  
Automation is encouraged: repository or CI/CD pipelines can enforce the presence of an up-to-date checklist, verify that all items are answered, and warn when “No” responses lack associated tickets or follow-up actions.
